        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
            Just Keep Spinning is a Dublin based studio focusing solely on spin classes.  
            This family-owned business was started by siblings Carl and Claudia, both high preforming athletes 
            with a passion for all things cardio.

        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>
                Push yourself for 30 to 45 minutes depending on which class you choose. Each class will have a minimum of one instructor 
                who will be on the bike for the whole class explaining each step and helping to push you even further.
