### Site Goals

The goal of Just Keep Spinning is to inform potential members (users) of what we have to offer. We want users to be able to visit the site and find all the information they need. We want users to be able to find information quickly, so we have chosen a simple design and kept content to a minimum. We have kept the structure of each of the 3 pages the same with uniformed nav bar and footer and image placement so that each page looks familiar to the user.

## UX
* Strategy
    * This website was designed and targeted towards people with a keen interest in cardio activity. There is a gap in the market in Dublin for a fitness studio that focuses solely on spinning classes. The target audience are busy professionals, or busy parents. They want to get in and get their workout done as quick as possible. We wanted this to be reflected on the website. Keep the content simplistic. Our target audience want the key information as quick as possible.

* Scope
    * The initial scope of this website is to provide the target audience with all the information they need to join our spin studio. We will provide information on pricing, class times, some brief information about us and what we are about. We will have contact details and links to our socials. We will provide a form where potential members can sign up for a free trial.

* Structure
    * We will go live with a basic structure. There will be 3 pages of the website. Each page will share the same header which will contain a logo and a navigation bar. Each page will share the same footer which will contain the social media links, contact details and a copyright notice. The home page will contain four inline blocks containing some introduction text. The membership page will have a similar layout to the home page and contain three inline blocks which will contain the membership prices. The user will find each page consistent with the next.

* Skeleton
    * By splitting the content over 3 pages, it gives the content room to breathe and helps the user to clearly see the information they need. We will invite the user to browse through the website for the key information, such as pricing and class times which the user will need to navigate to the 2nd page to find. We want the user to stay on the website as long as possible while still making it very easy to find the information that they need as quick as possible.

* Surface
    * We will stick to a very minimal colour palette for the website comprising of 4 main colours. We will use variations of these across the 3 pages to provide consistency and familiarity to the user. We will use just two fonts, one for headers and one for the body. The colours will provide a nice colour contrast which will make the content stand out to the user.

### Wireframes

See inital wireframe which was created using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

See updaed version for page 2 after i decided it was best to include a timetable of classes rather than the FAQ section.

See updated version for page 3 after I decided to include a Where to find us section

### Design Choices

*   For design I had a look around some websites that I know have a nice interface and are easy to navigate. I took a fancy to [Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/) and their colour scheme so I borrowed their hex values.

* For the font I took a look around
