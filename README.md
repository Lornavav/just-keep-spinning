## UX

### Site Goals

The goal of Just Keep Spinning is to inform potential members (users) of what we have to offer. We want users to be able to visit the site and find all the information they need. We want users to be able to find information quickly, so we have chosen a simple design and kept content to a minimum. We have kept the structure of each of the 3 pages the same with uniformed nav bar and footer and image placement so that each page looks familiar to the user.

### Design Choices
